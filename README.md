# Anti-Default

**Catch default language before it ships.**

Anti-Default flags colonial defaults, gendered assumptions, ableist metaphors, and widely documented dogwhistles in websites, docs, and code — then offers clearer alternatives you can use right away.

## Why teams use it

- **Review copy before publish** — paste text, upload a doc, or scan a page
- **Swap one phrase fast** — `you guys` → `you all` / `folks` / `y’all`
- **Learn coded language** — dogwhistle guide with signal, context, and clearer wording
- **Scan your repo** — CLI over source and docs
- **Tune what matters** — turn rules on/off and export a shareable style guide

Every suggestion cites the style guides and references behind it.

## What’s included

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Review** | Paste, upload PDF/DOCX/text, or review a URL. Export Markdown, CSV, or a GitHub checklist. |
| **Swap** | Look up a word or short phrase for inclusive alternatives. |
| **Dogwhistles** | What a phrase can signal, when context matters, and what to say instead. |
| **Rules** | Browse and tune the catalog. Soft heads-ups stay gentle when language is ambiguous. |
| **CLI** | `npm run analyze` over your repo — offline, same rules as the UI. |
